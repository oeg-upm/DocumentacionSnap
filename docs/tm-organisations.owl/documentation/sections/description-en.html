  As such, the main types of classes that are represented in this ontology are:

<ul>
  <li>Organisation, which is further specialised in Authority, Operator,
    ServicedOrganisation, ManagementAgent, TravelAgent and RetailConsortium.</li>
  <li>OrganisationPart, which is further specialised in Department, OrganisationUnit and
    ControlCenter.</li>
  <li>ContactDetails, which has the usual information on contact details of an
    organisation or any of its units.</li>
  <li>AdministrativeZone, which is a subclass of the general class Zone so as to allow
    referring to the administrative zones that organisations are responsible for.</li>
</ul>


The main types of properties that are represented in this ontology are:

<ul>
  <li>providesService, to specify the type of Service that an Organisation provides.</li>
  <li>operatesInAdministrativeZone, to specify the administrative zone in which an
    operator operates.</li>
  <li>characterisedBy, to specify the contact details of an organisation.</li>
  <li>timeZone in which the organisation operates/works.</li>
</ul>


It is important to note that the design of this ontology is rather simple given the fact that it imports the W3C Organization Ontology, which already includes the majority of aspects that needs to be represented to declare organisations.

There is also one reference SKOS Concept Scheme to refer to the types of organisations
that can be described using this ontology.
