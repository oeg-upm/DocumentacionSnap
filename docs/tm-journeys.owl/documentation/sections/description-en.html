<span class="markdown">
This module focuses on the representation of information about the journeys. As such, the
main types of classes that are represented in this ontology are:
</span>

<ul>
  <li>Block, which is the work of a vehicle from the time it leaves a ParkingPoint after
    parking until its next return to park at a Parking Point.</li>
  <li>DayTypeAssignment, the assignment of operational characteristics, expressed by
    DayType to particular OperatingDay within a ServiceCalendar.</li>
  <li>DestinationDisplay, an advertised destination of a specific Journey Pattern usually
    displayed on a headsign or other on-board locations.</li>
  <li>HeadwayInterval, which sets the time interval or the duration defining a headway
    period and characterizing HeadwayJourneyGroups</li>
  <li>VehicleJourney, a subClassOf Journey which sets the journey made by the
    Vehicle.</li>
  <li>Line, which defines a group of Routes which is generally known to the public by a
    similar name or number.</li>
  <li>LinkSequence, an ordered sequence either of POINTs or of LINKs, defining a path
    through the network.</li>
  <li>OperatingDay, the day of public transport operation of which the characteristics are
    defined within a specific ServiceCalendar.</li>
  <li>OperatingPeriod, which is a continuous interval of time between two Operating Day
    which will be used to define validities</li>
  <li>PointInLinkSequence, a point in a LinkSequence indicating its order in that
    particular LinkSequence.</li>
  <li>ScheduledStopPoint, a Point where a passenger can board or alight from a
    Vehicle.</li>
  <li>StopsAssignment, the allocation of a ScheduledStopPoint to a specific StopPlace, for
    either a ServiceJourney or VehicleService.</li>
  <li>VehicleMode, a characterisation of the public transport operation according to the
    means of transport (bus, tram, metro, train, ferry, ship).</li>
  <li>VehicleType, a classification of public transport vehicles according to the vehicle
    scheduling requirements in mode and capacity (e.g. standard bus, double-deck, ...).</li>
</ul>


The main types of properties that are represented in this ontology are:

<ul>
  <li>aViewOf allows relating a Point with the Points in Link Sequence where it
    appears</li>
  <li>describedAs, this property sets the relationship between PropertyOfDay and the SKOS
    ConceptScheme for days of the week.</li>
  <li>directionType, a property that allows describing the type of direction for a service
    journey</li>
  <li>season, which states the season of a OperatingPeriod</li>
  <li>stopUse allows describing the type of use of a stop (e.g., access, interchange only,
    pass through).</li>
  <li>vehicleModeID sets the relationship between a VehicleMode and the type of Vehicle
    used defined in the kos/journeys/all-modes.ttl</li>
</ul>

There is one reference SKOS Concept Scheme to refer to the types of organisations that can be described using this ontology.
